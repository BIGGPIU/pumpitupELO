# This project was supposed to get all teh charts you cleared and use that to give you an ELO based on the placement of the charts you cleared.
# Unfortunately though I got burned out mid way through so I'm stopping development for now. You can add to it if you feel like it. Follow the comments if you want to remake the tier list snapshot

# known problems
The program doesnt work lmao
tier list snapshot not returning teh right rating for everything. You could probably fix this yourself if it really really bothered you
