# PUMP IT UP ELO
This is a program that uses Doctor Murlocs https://piuscores.arroweclip.se/ to get all of your scores and give you a rating according to the glicko-2 system! There is no punishment for failing charts so dont even worry about it.

You can find what each clear is worth by looking in the "values.py" folder

# How to use
do ```pip install glicko2``` then ```pip install requests``` Then you're all good to run the code using the source code.

After you run the prrogram you can check elo.txt to see what elo you got

# Upcoming features 
* make it open a web interface and make the web interface look nice
* make it into an exe file
* improved numbers in values.py
* Leaderboards (maybe)
